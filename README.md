# Data-Portfolio
I just resumed my journey in the data space. This time I am more informed and knowledgeable. 

It's all geared towards data engineering and building sustainable and efficient pipelines for effective in-depth data analytics. 

But of course we start from the basics again. In this repo, I'll be documenting my progress and projects I did while taking the Dataquest Data Engineering track. 

Anticipate great things on this space.
