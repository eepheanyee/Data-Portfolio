# Data-Portfolio
I just decided to start documenting my journey in the data space. This time I am more informed and knowledgeable. 

It's all geared towards data engineering and building sustainable and efficient pipelines for effective in-depth data analytics to help businesses and individuals grow and make better decisions. 

But of course we start from the basics again. In this repo, I'll be documenting my progress and projects I did while taking the Dataquest Data Engineering track. 

Anticipate great things on this space.
